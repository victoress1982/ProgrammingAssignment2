## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is 
#really a list containing a function to:

#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix
#set the value of the inverse matrix
#get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}
  



## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
#created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the 
#inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from 
#the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean 
#of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
